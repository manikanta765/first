Webservice:--
------------
-- Webservice is a way for two applications or two electronics to communicate over a network.
-- It uses interoperable format to transfer the data between application.(interoperable means common language for all technologies
   i.e XML/JSON)
   
WebService Types:--
----------------
1. SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocal)
2. REST(Representational State Transfer)


Restful webservices:--
------------------------
Resource - What ever the data/response we will get from the server is knows as Resource.
Each Resource can be accessed by its URL's.
We can get the Resource from the Restful service in different format like HTML,XML,JSON,TEXT,PDF but we mainly prefer JSON only.
Rest guidelines always talks about stateless communication between client and the server.
Stateless means every single request from client to server will be considered as a fresh request.
Because of this reason Rest always prefers HTTP as it is a stateless protocal.

Caching:--
--------------------
Caching is process of storing server response in client side.so that a client needs not to make server request for same resource so 
many times.

JAX-RS Annotations:--
------------------
1. @webservice
2. @Path    ----- It's a class & method level of annotation
                  This will check the path next to the base URL
3. @PathParam
4. @GET
5. @POST
6. @PUT
7. @HEAD
8. @DELETE
9. @OPTIONS
10. @FormParam
11. @QueryParam
12. @HeaderParam
13. @CookieParam
14. @Produces --- here we will give our service to other person to utilize 
              --- we can say this is a method level annotation , By using this annotation we can the get the output as you like XML,JSON
                  plain text,HTML,Image,,,etc.
                  
               Note:-- Whenever we send a HTTP GET Request to our Restful service,it will invokes particular method and produces the output
                       in different formats.
                       We will use @ Produces for GET Request only.
15. @Consumes --- here we are using other person services
                  Whenver we are consume other services,
                  This is a class level and method level annotation
                  It decide which MIME type is consumed by the particular method 
                  i.e. Which format the method can accept the input from client
                  
                  
                      Receive Request from client we are using Extract input parameters
                      -------------------------
 1. @PathParam
 2. @QueryParam  --- If client sends an input in the form of Query String in the URL, then those parameters are called as
                     QueryParam.
                     ex: http://localhost:8080/Jaxrsannotaions/rest/car?carName=BMW here ? is the query param
                     Suppose we have two parameters we can divide using & like this car?carName=BMW&car=1
 3. @FormParam
 4. @MatrixParam --- If client sends an input in the form of Matrix String in the URL, then those parameters are called as
                     QueryParam.
                      ex: http://localhost:8080/Jaxrsannotaions/rest/car;carName=BMW
